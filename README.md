PowerBI ( US Healthcare Analysis )

**ðŸ“Œ Project Title:**

U.S. Healthcare Analytics Dashboard (2019â€“2020) â€“ A Power BI-Driven Insight Engine

**ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective:**

To build a comprehensive, interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into the performance, financials, patient demographics, and payer-provider dynamics within the U.S. healthcare system from 2019 to 2020, supporting data-driven decision-making for healthcare stakeholders.

**ðŸ§­ Project Approach:**

1.) Data Acquisition & Preparation:

 - Worked with healthcare datasets involving hospitals, patients, procedures (CPT codes), and financial metrics.

 - Cleaned and pre-processed the data for consistency and integrity.

2.) Data Modeling in Power BI:

 - Designed a robust data model with relationships between tables (patients, providers, payments, procedures).

 - Used DAX to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as ARGE ratio, IPTP ratio, patient payments, and net revenue.

3.) Dashboard Design:

 - Created multiple report pages for specific analyses:

 - Executive Summary â€“ High-level trends and KPIs

 - Hospital Insights â€“ Procedure counts, expenses, performance metrics

 - Patient Analysis â€“ Demographics, health habits, regional breakdown

 - Payer-Provider Dynamics â€“ Revenue sources, FTE analysis, specialty performance

 - Monthly Financial Overview â€“ Gross and adjusted expense tracking

 - Incorporated slicers and interactive filters for dynamic exploration by region, hospital, or specialty.

4.) Visualization:

 - Employed a user-friendly layout with graphs, maps, KPIs, and matrix tables to support intuitive insights and executive reporting.

**ðŸ“ˆ Outcome from the Project:**

1.) Delivered a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that allows healthcare professionals to:

 - Monitor hospital and provider performance

 - Analyze patient trends and outcomes

 - Track revenue sources and expense efficiencies

2.) Identified key cost drivers and underperforming areas, aiding strategic decision-making.

3.) Demonstrated practical expertise in using Power BI for real-world healthcare data visualization and storytelling.

4.) Project is published on GitHub to showcase technical and analytical capabilities.
